<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Laura and I have been learning to code for a couple of weeks. This is my first attempt tp build a website and Im only using HTML elements</p>

<p>Before embarking on this course I worked as a sound engineer for theatre, working on a number of different shows over the ten years I had built my career.
  A mixture of Covid and the point I have reached in my life have lead me to starting this course and learning what it takes to be a web developer.
</p>

<p>I have been having a lot of fun though have found the start of this course easy (I am sure not long down the line I will start to face some challenges!)</p>
